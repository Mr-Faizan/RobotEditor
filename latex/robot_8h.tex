\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Declaration of \doxylink{class_robot}{Robot} class for robot entity and joint aggregation. 

This file defines the \doxylink{class_robot}{Robot} class, which represents a robot entity composed of joints. The \doxylink{class_robot}{Robot} class manages robot-\/level properties (name, manufacturer, payload, etc.), and provides methods for adding, creating, and retrieving joints. Joints are aggregated as part of the robot, and each joint can have its own kinematics, dynamics, and visualization data.

Main features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Store robot properties (name, manufacturer, payload, reach, etc.)
\item Aggregate and manage multiple joints
\item Provide setters and getters for all properties
\item Add, create, and retrieve joints by joint number
\end{DoxyItemize}
